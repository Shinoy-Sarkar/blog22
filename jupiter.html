            <h2>The Great Red Spot of Jupiter</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Humanity and Earth have always witnessed countless storms throughout their lifetime. 
                The longest one ever recorded on Earth was Hurricane John in 1994, which lasted 31 days, 
                traveling a distance of 13,000 as it wandered across the Pacific ocean. 
                This storm, which can be called monumental by Earth standards, 
                is nothing compared to the vast, iconic, churning red hurricane of our giant sibling,
                 Jupiter, which has been there for at least the last 375 years, with more than twice 
                 the speed of the fastest one on Earth. Ever since its discovery in the seventeenth century
                  by Giovanni Domenico Cassini, this giant typhoon called the Giant Red Spot(GRS) has 
                  always been a topic of discussion with various mysterious questions like :
                   why is it swirling for centuries? What gives them the churning red color? 
                   Why is it staying on one spot? And the most discussed one, will this enigmatic cloud 
                   disappear anytime soon?

  
            </p>
            <p> Located  22 degrees south of Jupiter's equator, GRS is a high-pressure region
                twice as broad as the Earth, producing gigantic storms in the anticlockwise direction.
                With a period of rotation of about six Earth days or fourteen Jovian days, 
                the wind speeds on the edges of these oval-shaped rotating clouds reach up to
                430-680 km/h while they stay relatively calmer at the center. Confined within 
                two jet streams, the eastward-moving atmospheric band to its north and a
                westward-moving band to its south, these streams formed this giant storm and
                made them stay in one place, unlike Earth. The lack of solid surface on the gas
                giant also adds to the longevity of this fast-moving gale. On Earth,
                the power of a hurricane comes from warm vapor evaporating from the sea, 
                which releases heat into the air. Under the right conditions, this creates 
                a low-pressure area with warm air rising and cooler air getting sucked in
                at the bottom. Since the Earth spins at a higher velocity closer to the 
                equator, winds traveling towards the low-pressure area begin to curve,
                causing the hurricane. A hurricane will start dissipating once it reaches 
                land, where it no longer receives the warm vapor it needs to keep the cycle
                going. Since Jupiter does not have the contrast of ocean and land, nothing 
                will halt the fast-moving storm, making them active for centuries.

                Today scientists know the Great Red Spot is there and it has been there for a while,
                 but they still struggle to learn about its composition and properties, and it’s mostly 
                 Jupiter’s fault. In a gaseous planet a thousand times as big as Earth with a liquid ocean 
                 of hydrogen surrounding its core and a thick layer of atmosphere that can even trap 
                 radio waves, investigating the red spot with orbiting probes and telescopes will not
                yield accurate results. Though available data from Jovian missions and telescopes 
                predicted that Jupiter’s upper atmosphere has clouds consisting of ammonia,
                ammonium hydrosulfide, and water, and the reddish hue of the storm is due to 
                the irradiation of the hydrogen sulfide layer with the cosmic rays from the sun,
                these are not yet scientifically proved and are still in dark!

                In recent years there have been a bunch of dire warnings about the great red spot
                 dying in the press. While in the scientific world itself, there are controversies
                  regarding this, let us take a brief look at the two sets of arguments. As the oval-shaped 
                  storm contracts and becomes more circular, it also grows taller and changes color, 
                  becoming a more intense orange. While the data from the Voyager mission and Hubble 
                  telescope are in favor of this comment, thereby supporting the news about the demise
                   of this enigmatic red cloud, some scientists are against this as a decrease in the 
                   area of the cloud does not imply the shrinking of the vortex. Since the area of the 
                   spot cloud is larger than its underlying vortex and the swirling gas that defines 
                   it, to understand the health of the spot, planetary scientists need to study the 
                   health of its vortex and not its cloud. Since the current observation is about 
                   the clouds, they strongly argue that with this information, one cannot say whether 
                   it is on the verge of flaking or not.

            </p>
            <p>Whatever be the end of this debate, the great red spot has always been the most intriguing
                 Jovian factor and knowing more about Jupiter and its Great Red Spot could help scientists
                  understand Earth’s weather system better as both the weather functions under the same physics.
