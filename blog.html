                    While there are millions and billions of stars in our universe, what draws our attention is the one residing at the center of our solar system i,e, The Sun. 4.5 billions years ago, the collapse of the solar nebula in the Orion spur of our milky way galaxy gave birth to this yellow dwarf star. Besides being remarkable with its nuclear reactions ,tremendous gravity, and helping humankind to sustain life,

                    Mercury has the most eccentric orbit of all planets. Eccentricity here is not exclusive to the mathematical definition, as in this case mercury displays eccentric characteristics if seen from the linguistic definition of the word as well. Mercury's orbit has an eccentricity of 0.206, the highest of all planets. For comparison, the eccentricity of the earth around the sun is 0.016, around 12 times less than that of Mercury. In 1843, French astronomer Urbain Le Verrier began studying the motion of Mercury. In 1859, he published

                    In the 1930s, astronomers used spectroscopy to measure the temperature of Venus’s upper atmosphere. They found it to be about 240 K, not much different from that of Earth’s stratosphere.Taking into account the cloud cover and the planet’s nearness to the Sun, and assuming that Venus had an atmosphere much like our own, researchers concluded that Venus might have an average surface temperature only a few degrees higher than Earth’s.

You pick up an individual sand particle and dissect it under a microscope, into its constituent atoms. That’s about how large a terrestrial planet looks like on a galactic scale. Our own planet in this respect looks just as significant as its 100 billion counterparts in our own galaxy. But sometimes the most insignificant of things carry the most value. So what is it that brings our attention to the very place we call home? Well, for starters, let us

Grumbling, she hurried down the corridor to the reconnaissance station, glancing at the weather forecast once. It predicted clear weather with a temperature of -77oF. Some freak storm must have come up and covered the equipment in dust. Indeed at the equipment hold, she got some intel, “A dust devil close to the excavation site, small enough to be ignored as a blip on the satellite cameras.”  Such are the situations the Martian settlers will have to face on the Red Planet.

                    Humanity and Earth have always witnessed countless storms throughout their lifetime. The longest one ever recorded on Earth was Hurricane John in 1994, which lasted 31 days, traveling a distance of 13,000 as it wandered across the Pacific ocean. This storm, which can be called monumental by Earth standards, is nothing compared to the vast, iconic, churning red hurricane of our giant sibling, Jupiter, which has been there for at least the last 375 years, with more than twice the speed of the fastest one on Earth. Ever since its discovery in the seventeenth century by Giovanni Domenico Cassini, this giant typhoon called the Giant Red Spot(GRS) has always been a topic of discussion with various mysterious questions like : why is it swirling for centuries? What gives them the churning red color? Why is it staying on one spot? And the most discussed one, will this enigmatic cloud disappear anytime soon? Located  22 degrees south of Jupiter's equator,

                    All four gas giant planets in our solar system have rings that orbit around them. Still, the rings of Saturn are unique among all of them as they are so big and bright that even in 1610, Galileo Galilei observed them using an ordinary telescope but could not identify them. So, he wrote that Saturn is not alone but surrounded by three ears (he called rings ears at that time), which are stationary to each other. Later in 1655, Christian Huygens confirmed this ring as a disc.
                    Saturn's rings are made of ice and rock that vary in size. Some are as small as a grain of sand, others as large as a house. There are two main theories regarding the origin of the inner rings of Saturn. An idea that Édouard Roche proposed in the 19th century suggested the rings be formed from the debris of what was once a moon of
