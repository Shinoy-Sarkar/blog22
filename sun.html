                While there are millions and billions of stars in our universe, what draws our attention is
                the one residing at the center of our solar system i,e, The Sun. 4.5 billions years ago,
                the collapse of the solar nebula in the Orion spur of our milky way galaxy gave birth to
                this yellow dwarf star.
                Besides being remarkable with its nuclear reactions ,tremendous gravity, and helping
                humankind to sustain life, this yellow dwarf has its own peculiarities lying over its
                surface, Sun’s Magnetic Field.
  
            </p>
            <p>
                The Sun is a massive ionized ball of plasma , composed of electrons and ions, and
                when these charged ions move, they create strong magnetic fields and corresponding
                electric currents. This motion creates a lot of activity on the Sun's surface, called solar
                activity. The Sun's surface may be quite active at once but quieter at other times. The
                intensity of these activities are not constant but fluctuate as the 11 year-long solar cycle
                progresses. Sunspots, solar flares, and Coronal Mass Ejections (CME) are some of the
                phenomena caused by these fluctuations in magnetic field as the solar cycle advances.
                Let us now dig a little deeper into these phenomena :

                        <b>Sunspots:</b> Sunspots are transitory dark spots on the Sun's photosphere that
                        are darker than the surrounding region. They are areas of lower surface
                        temperature induced by magnetic flux concentrations.The magnetic field is so
                        powerful that it prevents part of the convective currents carrying the sun’s
                        heat from reaching its surface. They develop in pairs, generally with opposite
                        magnetic polarity, within active zones. Sunspots are made up of two primary
                        structures: a center umbra and a penumbra that surrounds it. The umbra is
                        the sunspot's darkest zone, and it is here that the magnetic field is greatest
                        and perpendicular to the Sun's surface, or photosphere. A brighter zone
                        known as the penumbra may entirely or partially encircle the umbra. The
                        penumbra has a higher inclined magnetic field than the umbra and is made
                        up of radially elongated formations known as penumbral filaments. Sunspots
                        have a diameter ranging from 16 km to 160,000 km (more than 10 times the
                        radius of Earth) and they grow and compress as they travel around the Sun's
                        surface. The solar cycle comprising the maximum number of sunspots are
                        termed as solar maximum while the least ones are designated as solar
                        minimum.

                        <b>Solar Flares:</b> The sun is more like a fluid than a solid ball. It has differential
                        rotation, which means that depending on latitude, the surface moves at
                        various speeds. The magnetic field lines become wrapped up because of this,
                        which can result in a solar flare, which is a quick burst of energy. Flares occur
                        when accelerated charged particles, mostly electrons, interact with the
                        plasma medium. All layers of the solar atmosphere, the photosphere,
                        chromosphere, and corona are affected by solar flares. The plasma medium
                        is heated to tens of millions of Kelvins, and electrons, protons, and heavier
                        ions are propelled to relativistic speeds. Flares emit electromagnetic radiation
                        at all wavelengths, from radio waves to gamma rays, spanning the
                        electromagnetic spectrum. Most of the energy is dispersed over frequencies
                        outside of our visual range; therefore, most flares are invisible to the human
                        eye and must be viewed using specific tools. Flares are seen in active areas,
                        often surrounding sunspots, where powerful magnetic fields penetrate the
                        photosphere and connect the corona to the solar interior.

                        Coronal Mass Ejections (CME): A coronal mass ejection (CME) is a large
                        burst of plasma,consisting of electrons, protons and magnetic field from the
                        Sun's corona to the solar winds. Solar flares are one of the consequences of
                        these CMEs. In the sun’s atmosphere, plasma gets confined in arch like
                        structures by the strong magnetic fields called coronal loops. Sometimes,
                        these magnetic field lines in the plasma break and reconnect with each other,
                        thus releasing a massive amount of magnetic energy. This energy goes into
                        the kinetic energy of the solar flares and into thermal energy which is believed
                        to be the reason why the sun’s corona has a temperature of the order of
                        millions of Kelvins. The Sun produces three CMEs per day around solar
                        maximum, but only one every 5 days near solar minima. An interplanetary
                        coronal mass ejection (ICME) occurs when a CME penetrates interplanetary
                        space. ICMEs can reach Earth's magnetosphere and collide with it, causing
                        geomagnetic storms, aurorae, and, in rare situations, damage our electrical
                        power grids.
